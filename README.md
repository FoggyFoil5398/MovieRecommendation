# MovieRecommendation

Important! : MovieRecommenderAndScorePredictor notebook is the one you should be looking for. Thefirsttry notebook is my first ever attempt on a kaggle dataset which failed miserably (hence the negative score in the end). The MoviesRecommender notebook is based on a kernel on kaggle more about which information is down below !


1. The repository is made for generating movie recommendations using python.
2. The work has been done solely on python on jupyter notebook.

The repository involves EDA and recommendation generation on a movies dataset consisting of 5000 movies, both of which have been explained in the notebook itself.
The dataset has been taken from kaggle.com and can be found at below link :

P.S. The work is an adaptation of someone else's and my first time exposure to how eda and recommendation system works (with respect to movies dataset). I have learnt the entire techniques, analysis and recommendation generation from Ashwini Swains kernel which can be found on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/what-s-my-score. This was my first time being exposed to kaggle environment and kernels altogether and through ashwini's work, the exposure was definitely worth it ! It not only made me realise what are the things I was lacking or not giving myself into to understad but also how a real world analysis is carried out. This was also my first time performing EDA.

I have altered the code which I didn't understand and replaced it with my own, serving practically the same purpose !
Any suggestions/queries are openly welcomed. 





Peace People !
